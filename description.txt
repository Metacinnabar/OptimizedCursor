Optimized Cursor is a Terraria mod that modifies the in-game cursor to run at the same FPS as your computer instead of the FPS of Terraria. While it significantly alters cursor speed, it maintains vanilla cursor functionality.

Keep in mind that this mod lacks support for
- gamepads
- screen capture menu
- rainbow cursor
- any mods that change the cursor

For any bugs or mod incompatibilities either make a comment on the Steam workshop or write up an issue through GitHub.
