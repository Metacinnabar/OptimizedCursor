Optimized Cursor is a mod for Terraria that provides an optimized cursor in-game. It includes support for cursor outlines, colors, smart cursor, and special cursors such as the trash and favorite cursors.

This mod completely changes how the game shows its cursor, but it still includes support for various cursor features. It does this by using techniques such as injecting calls to an UpdateCursor method into various cursor-related methods in the game's code and using On.Terraria to override those same methods and add additional calls to UpdateCursor.

In addition to these techniques, Optimized Cursor also uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and pointers to change the texture of the cursor. The SetCursor method is used to set the cursor to a specified texture and works by declaring width and height variables, initializing a Color array, getting the data of the texture and assigning it to the Color array, pinning the array in memory, creating an IntPtr using the address of the first element of the array, creating a new surface using the IntPtr, width, height, and a specified format, and creating a new cursor from the surface and setting it using SDL. There is also a version of the SetCursor method that takes both a cursor texture and an outline texture as arguments and works similarly, but first creates a render target and a sprite batch to draw the textures to memory before creating the cursor ready to be swapped through SDL.

It's worth noting that this mod has not been tested with a gamepad and does not provide support for the screen capture menu. It has also not been tested with the rainbow cursor.
                                                           
Overall, Optimized Cursor provides an optimized cursor experience in Terraria, including support for cursor outlines, colors, smart cursor, and special cursors. Its use of SDL and pointers allows it to change the texture of the cursor to a specified image, providing a fast way of changing the cursor. If you're looking to improve your cursor experience in Terraria, give Optimized Cursor a try.
